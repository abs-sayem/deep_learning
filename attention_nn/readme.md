### **Attention Neural Network**
**What is Attention?**
###### **Suppose I give you `Deep Learning with Python` book and ask you to tell about `neural style transfer` from the book. What would you do - either start reading the whole book or check the index to find out where "neural style transfer" is talked about, go there and read the related portion. The second way is more precise because you draw the attention in the region of interest.**
